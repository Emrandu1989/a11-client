# Technologies Used: We leverage modern technologies to ensure a smooth user experience. Our frontend is built using React, providing dynamic and interactive user interfaces. Firebase powers our backend infrastructure, offering real-time database capabilities and secure authentication. For database management, we utilize MongoDB, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval.

# Authentication and Security: FoodShare+ implements robust authentication mechanisms to safeguard user accounts and data. Users can register and log in securely using email/password credentials or through Google/Github sign-in options. Additionally, we employ JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure communication between the client and server, ensuring data integrity and user privacy.

# Features Highlights:
